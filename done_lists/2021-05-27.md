* [ ] looking into kafka things
  * [x] why is it acting this way? add extra logging
  * [x] try changing the autocommit parameters to see if that helps
  * [x] it doesn't. but weirdly, seems like consumer processes a few messages in the queue, then goes back to being stuck in the beginning
  * [x] looking thru kafkajs code to try and figure out why it's not sending heartbeat (is it sending heartbeats?)
  * [x] should we be limiting the batch size?
  * [x] adding event listener to check for heartbeats being sent
  * [x] no logs. is the listener working? adding it to other consumers
  * [x] logs heartbeats for other consumers
  * [x] stumped.
  * [x] let's just manually fix offsets for now. check out later. might need to try using `eachBatch` to manually send heartbeats, or also listen to batch processing events.
